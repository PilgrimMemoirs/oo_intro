### OBJECT ORIENTATION INTRO ####
  #Object Orientation allows us to setup one, generic class that will allow us to create MANY objects that we can then customize.
  #Objects are customized by providing specific data for it's attributes.
    #We want a username for every user. So we setup the functionality to have a username.
    #When we create a new user, we then provide a specific username.

    ##EXAMPLE##
    #Think of facebook who has over 1.7 BILLION users. Yes. Billion. Seven of those Billon. Mind blown.
    #There's not a fb engineer that goes making special hashes of every new users information. That would be insanity.
    #Instead, it's better if they create a template (or blueprint or cookie cutter) that structures what a user is and what they are allowed to do.
    #Then, as a user signs up, a new user object is created and they just need to populate the object with their specific data.



### LETS CREATE THE NEXT FACEBOOK ##
  # We are creating the next facebook and we want to create a class so that our website can scale easily to accomodate our potential 1.7 billion users.  Those users have something called attributes and methods.
  
  #Attributes are the nouns. They are what describe a user.
  #Methods are the verbs. They are what a user is able to do.


  ### PLAN BEFORE WE PROCEED ###
  ###What attributes does a user have?
      #(with a pair, use a whiteboard to make a list of user's attributes)


  ###What functionality does a user have?
      #(with a pair, use a whiteboard to make a list of user's functionality)
